        Type Conversion:

        In Python, data type conversion, also known as type casting, can be performed explicitly and implicitly. Here's an explanation of both:
        
        1. Implicit Type Conversion (Automatic Type Conversion):
           Implicit type conversion occurs automatically when Python converts one data type to another without any direct action from the programmer. 
        
        2. Explicit Type Conversion (Type Casting):
           Explicit type conversion, also known as type casting, involves the programmer explicitly converting one data type to another. You can use built-in functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, and others to convert between data types. This is useful when you want to control the type conversion or when it's not happening automatically, and you want to ensure compatibility.
        
        Explicit type conversion:
        
        int(x): Converts `x` to an integer.
        float(x): Converts `x` to a floating-point number.
        str(x): Converts `x` to a string.
        bool(x): Converts `x` to a boolean value.
        list(x): Converts `x` to a list.
        tuple(x): Converts `x` to a tuple.
        set(x): Converts `x` to a set.
        
        
        input() function:
        In Python, you can get input from the user using the `input()` function. 
        
        input() function always returns the user's input as a string. If you need the input in a different data type, like an integer or a float, you should perform explicit type conversion after using input().
        It stops the flow of the program until the user input the details.
